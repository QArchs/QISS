# QISS
## Quantum Instructıon Set for Systems 

   Technology is developing after the dawn of the civilization. The more we advance, the faster development occurs. It implies an exponential growth. A few decades ago we didn’t have high speed computing devices. Calculations must have be done by hand and paper; however, now, we are able to do so in microseconds. It’s very unimaginable for people living a few hundred years ago. Another unimaginable fact has built a couple of months ago. It was an implementation of QALU( Quantum Arithmetic Logic Units) which is a milestone of QArch Project. It was capable of performing thousands of addition operation. When it was proposed firstly, no one couldn’t have believed it. However, it was created with only three months of work. Apparent implication of this fact is that rate of exponential growth on now is similar as difference between a few decades ago and a few hundred years ago. With the introduction of QISS, the growth will be faster. This situation can be explained by an analogy. Just as with the introduction of microcontrollers we wouldn’t need to combine IC’s in order to process information then a speedup has arose in the information technologies, we will no longer need to create complicated circuits and all of these can be done with a software then being available easier development, the faster growth will be the case.
